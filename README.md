# NOTE: I am not gonna release the guide or such and what to even start with using because: 1, further research and testing must be done and i dont want people wasting precious console ids and such and 2, even though if this will ever foreseeably be able to finished, we might as well just release it by the end of the Switch life span so that lobbies arent filled with hackers and cheaters etc,

if you want to be prepared for when this will be released, go buy yourself a switch cheap off of ebay (v2 w/ modchip or not) and make sure it works online
